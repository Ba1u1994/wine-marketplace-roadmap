# Wine Marketplace – Public Roadmap & Devlog

This repository tracks the **high-level roadmap**, **weekly progress**, and **architecture notes** for my private Wine Marketplace project.

> 🛡 **Note:** This repo contains **no production code** – only documentation, diagrams, and progress logs.  
> The actual application code lives in a private repository.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Wine Marketplace** is a full-stack platform focused on:

- Export-oriented sales of Georgian and niche wines  
- Multi-producer / multi-vendor structure  
- Transparent logistics, pricing, and compliance for EU / US markets  

The main goals of this project are:

- To design a clean, scalable backend architecture (.NET, EF, SQL)  
- To build an admin-friendly panel for managing wineries, wines, orders, and exports  
- To document my learning and progress publicly (GitHub + LinkedIn), while keeping code private
